today i

69
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,519
wanted to finish up or like play through the rest of stanley parable because the

70
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,920
last time we played it for the people that were there and watched the vod we

71
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,519
couldn't finish it because my internet was just like oh haha let's do let's do

72
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,320
something funny and mode and it shut down

73
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,680
like during a very convenient part which was kind of spooky but um yeah

74
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,120
i just couldn't keep playing the game because my internet kept going on and

75
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,320
off that day so i decided to just reschedule

76
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,680
it for this weekend hopefully we don't have any more internet problems come on

77
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,440
guys guys i need you i need everybody here to like manifest good [ __ ]

78
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,040
internet so that we can finish this game i don't know if it'll happen again i

79
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,040
really doubt it will because i feel like the only times i have like sussy

80
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,959
internet is when it's like later into the night

81
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,760
so i don't understand like uh if it were to happen again like the only

82
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,320
other time that it kind of happened before was like when i was uh finishing

83
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,399
it takes to a vox um a month ago so i don't think it will

84
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,000
happen again in the morning that is

85
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,640
yeah yeah no no bad internet manifest only good internet so we can finish this

86
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,360
game oh yeah by the way i hope everyone's

87
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,959
been enjoying the new video that i uploaded to my youtube so uh i

88
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,600
have been i talked with a new editor and they uh decided like i've been working

89
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,680
with them and they want to uh you know edit down the overcooked collab that i

90
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,720
had with vox and into like one good video and i think it

91
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,160
came out really really well so you guys should definitely check it out it's on

92
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,200
my youtube channel and um just let me know in the future if

93
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,920
there's like any other games that you would want to see us play because we've

94
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,240
been talking about different games that we want to try together but

95
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,839
and i think vox suggested chess like the old dog he is but like dude

96
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,640
i don't know i feel like chess is something i would want to do

97
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,200
like off stream more than like on stream i don't know who would want to watch us

98
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,399
like play chess for like five hours dude like

99
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,160
okay maybe maybe i'm like doubting myself too much but maybe a lot of you

100
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,720
actually but it's it's like i don't know i feel like i'd be so focused on the

101
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,399
game and so focused on trying to like you know mind game him so i don't know

102
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,720
if like playing chess for like that long will be would be uh feasible but yeah um

103
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,640
yeah if there's any cool collab games out there that you know about that you

104
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,160
think we would enjoy that'll like you know hit the same kind of vibe as like

105
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,320
overclocked and it takes two other fun multiplayer co-ops then uh let me know

106
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,839
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah i suck at chess

107
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,959
though i haven't played chess like really seriously since like high school

108
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,800

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,320
[ __ ] awesome like i did not expect to enjoy it that much and like i don't know

140
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,040
like the the banter from the from the narrator is so funny too like

141
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,440
i know there's a multiple endings for the game like 40 something right 42 is

142
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,000
it 42 or is it more and we got like only like a handful right like a few of it

143
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
i'd say like less than 10. so we got like quite a few more to go i don't know

144
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,519
maybe i'll replay through some of the endings again because like

145
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,959
i don't know i really like the one where it just like propelled us into fire

146
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,040

263
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,440
can't believe it's happening again

264
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,760
oh yeah we shouldn't be down here but here we are but stanley just couldn't do

265
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,240
it he considered the possibility of facing his boss admitting he had left

266
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,120
his post during work hours he might be fired for that and in such a competitive

267
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,480
economy why had he taken that risk all because he believed everyone had

268
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,559
vanished his boss would think he was crazy yeah i'm pretty crazy something

269
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,240
occurred to stanley maybe maybe to himself maybe i am crazy i am crazy all

270
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,960
of my co-workers blinking mysteriously out of existence in a single moment for

271
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,559
no reason at all none of it made any logical sense

272
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,039
for example why couldn't he see his feet when he looked down huh why did doors

273
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,760
close automatically behind him wherever he went oh man you're creeping

274
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,840
rooms were starting to look pretty familiar were they simply repeating

275
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,720
no stanley said to himself this is all too strange this can't be real and at

276
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,279
last he came to the conclusion that had been on the tip of his tongue he just

277
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,360
hadn't found the words for it i'm dreaming

278
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,600
he yelled this is all a dream oh what a relief stanley felt to have

279
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,360
finally found an answer an explanation his co-workers weren't actually gone he

280
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,120
wasn't going to lose his job he wasn't crazy after all

281
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,600
and he thought to himself i suppose i'll wake up soon i'll have to go back to my

282
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,320
boring real-life job pushing buttons i may as well enjoy this while i'm still

283
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,559
lucid so he imagined himself flying and began

284
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,159
to gently float above the ground then he imagined himself soaring through

285
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:30,799
space on a magical starfield and it too appeared it was so much fun and stanley

286
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,520
mother the [ __ ] has happened still not woken up

287
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,159
how was he remaining so lucid and then perhaps the strangest question

288
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,039
of them all entered stanley's head one he was amazed he hadn't asked himself

289
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,720
sooner why is there a voice in my head

290
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,240
dictating everything that i'm doing and thinking

291
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,559
now the voice was describing itself being considered by stanley who found it

292
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,480
particularly strange i'm dreaming about a voice describing me thinking about how

293
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,440
it's describing my thoughts he thought and while he thought it all very odd and

294
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,279
wondered if this voice spoke to all people in their dreams the truth was

295
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,440
that of course this was not a dream how could it be

296
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,600
was stanley simply deceiving himself believing that if he's asleep he doesn't

297
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,120
have to take responsibility for himself stanley is as awake right now as he's

298
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,120
ever been in his life what's happening dude now hearing the voice speak these

299
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,320
words was quite a shock to stanley after all he knew for certain beyond a doubt

300
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,000
that this was in fact a dream did the voice not see him float and make the

301
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,480
magical stars just a moment ago how else would the voice explain all that this

302
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,600
voice was a part of himself too surely surely if he could just

303
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,760
he would prove it he would prove that he was in control

304
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,760
that this was a dream so he closed his eyes gently and he invited himself to

305
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,120
wake up he felt the cool weight of the blanket

306
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,279
on his skin the press of the mattress on his back

307
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,520
the fresh air of a world outside this one

308
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,720
let me wake up he thought to himself i'm through with this dream

309
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,120
i wish it to be over i let me go back to my job

310
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,559

and everything went black what the [ __ ] dude

321
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,760
actually this is the story of a woman named mariella huh

322
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,640
wait why ella woke up on a day like any other

323
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,880
she arose got dressed gathered her belongings and walked to her place of

324
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,559
work but on this particular day her walk was interrupted by the body of a man

325
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,640
he stumbled through town talking and screaming to himself and then collapsed

326
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,559
dead on the sidewalk and although she would soon turn to go call for an

327
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,919
ambulance i died for just a few brief moments she considered the strange man i

328
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,279
died obviously crazy this much she knew everyone knows what crazy people look

329
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,720
like and in that moment she thought to herself how lucky she was to be normal

330
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:04,640
i am saying i am in control of my mind i know what is real and what isn't

331
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,279
it was comforting to think this and in a certain way seeing this man made her

332
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,399
feel better but then she remembered the meeting she

333
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,960
had scheduled for that day the very important people whose impressions of

334
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,600
her would affect her career and by extension the rest of her life

335
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,799
she had no time for this so it was only a moment that she stood there staring

336
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,710
down at the body and then she turned and ran

337
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:36,720

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,520
oh you've got to be kidding me you see stanley this is what happens when greedy

431
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,599
video game developers with no respect for their fan base rush a cheap

432
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,240
expansion to market for no reason other than to make an easy dollar and don't

433
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,200
get me started on the level of craftsmanship that's gone into it in

434
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,720
fact i'm looking right now at the game's achievements and it's hard to believe

435
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,520
one of them actually says test achievement please ignore what quality

436
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,160
assurance department signed off on this i'm infuriated and i'm offended and i i

437
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,119
intend to find these people on twitter and help them personally accountable

438
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,640
what's the male equivalent of a character too much anticipation around

439
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,359
the new content i'm afraid he could never have lived up to such expectations

440
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,760
if you're still with me why don't we just reset the game and we'll try to get

game's developers for making a money grab game

449
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,520

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,760
and unsatisfying the new ultra deluxe content turned out to be but it got me

468
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,560
thinking about the past and how much better the stanley parable used to be so

469
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,800
i made something special and tucked it away here where the games developers

470
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,560
won't find it just our little secret

471
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,560
take a look what the [ __ ] is this

472
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,800

473
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,280

of the stanley parable like this stunning triumph of games journalism 10

513
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,119
out of 10 from destructoid.com james stephanie sterling

514
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,359
writes and i quote we're so many games that aspire to be

515
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,720
more than games end up less than any form of art stanley parable strives and

516
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,400
then succeeds to be every game ever created did you hear that stanley every

517
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,599
game ever created that's how grand and all-encompassing the original stanley

518
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,440
parable was it was literally every game ever created it was skyrim it was

519
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,720
persona 3. it was all of them and now it's nothing i played persona 3 and

520
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,839
stanley parable why isn't even the stanley parable anymore it's just a husk

521
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:00,079
now a lifeless husk with an hour of new

522
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:05,280
elevator content damn i didn't realize i played skyrim

523
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,839
and persona 3 in the span of one hour last time

524
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,359
minecraft wait why is there minecraft wait what's

525
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:18,480
that door why does that look so eerie it's like a creepypasta

526
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,599
what's with the minecraft picture huh

527
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,079

528
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,119
okay now yo downstairs or they go up here

529
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,359
oh

530
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,520
and memory zone maintenance hold on hold on we have two options here

531
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,319
the original remake do i give a [ __ ] about this or should i

532
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,480

533
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,920

535
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,359
doesn't let me go inside let me go inside you

536
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,720
here's another moving passage this time from gamespot.com

537
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,200
the stanley parable is both a richly stimulating commentary on the nature of

538
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,599
choice in games and one that offers some of the most enjoyable surprising and

539
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,000
rewarding choices i've ever been confronted with in a game nine out of

540
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,200
ten don't you get it stanley the game was perfect it didn't need anything else

541
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,800
it didn't need new content it just needed to be left alone to spend

542
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,680
the rest of time collecting dust in the hallowed hall of beloved video game

543
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,359
members get me out get me out

544
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,599
oh

545
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,960
these were simpler times stanley but i wouldn't give to go back to have

546
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,760
it all over again wait

547
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,800
hang on i don't recall this part of the memory

548
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,520
zone before what's this what's down here

549
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:04,720
oh where was this oh no oh god no stanley it's a

550
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,760
collection of reviews from steam the online video game distributor i haven't

551
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,280
looked at these in years i can't even team reviews collecting

552
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:22,720
oh boy oh boy we get so we get to read some we have to read some hater comments

553
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,560
here we go you bothered to play this game to full completion the narrator is

554
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,200
obnoxious and unfunny with his humor and dialogue proving to

555
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:37,440
be more irritating than entertaining i'm funny i'm not trying to be funny i'm

556
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,960
trying to make a serious work of art i suppose i could write up a handful of

557
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,280
gags to insert into the stanley parable but the game is already such a densely

558
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,480
layered web wow unfunny

559
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,280
that i can't even imagine where i'd have the room to stick them he couldn't

560
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,240
handle one bad criticism damn i'm lucky bro

561
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,000
call him unfunny poor narrator you know dude i think you're funny

562
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,920
you're a pretty funny guy a pretty funny face

563
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,599
yeah maybe this was a bad idea maybe we

564
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,920
shouldn't have gone here it feels like uh

565
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,880
a left or dead map for some for some reason

566
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,599
this is not opening hello oh hey another bad review see what

567
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,160
this one says while the idea for the game is good

568
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,480
for someone who prefers non-linear games this preachiness gets annoying fast

569
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,839
preachy stanley i'm not preachy am i you wouldn't tell me if i'm preachy

570
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:42,640
honestly you can oh goodness this is actually quite shocking for me but i

571
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,319
always will to be honest i had always thought of the game's dialogue as being

572
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,640
rather tears to begin with you can't know how much fluff i cut from

573
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:55,359
the game to get it to feel as light and airy as it well i always thought it did

574
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:00,640
but maybe it wasn't uh i i yeah what an awful memory to have to hold on

575
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,160
to i think he's pretty uh my otherwise unimpeachable track record

576
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,040
i feel like a failure

577
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,520
like i let these people down perhaps the stanley parable isn't quite

578
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:19,599
as sterling as i always remembered he he saw two bad reviews and he was

579
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:24,079
like i'm a failure what no

580
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,839
bro why you can't just just like take that

581
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,520
as like oh my god it's such a you know it's like

582
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,319
the small amount of people are like oh you're terrible i hate this person right

583
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:39,200
there's always gonna be the small percent of people that don't like you

584
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,839
right or like like the game or like whoever

585
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,160
focus on all the good all the people that support you

586
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,400
support the game i wish i could jump right now my god i miss the jumping

587
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,800
circle

588
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,800
yeah poor narrator no there's another one

589
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,280
what's this one got to say 2014. you constantly have to stop doing

590
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,000
anything so the narrator can catch up with his long-winded explanations of

591
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,800
what's happening i wish there was a skip button

592
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,440
a skip button well well yes yes i think we can do that

593
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,920
if i'm truly too preachy then then maybe letting you skip ahead for just a moment

594
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,720
surely it couldn't hurt not if it means we can strike these negative reviews

595
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,359
from the record only positive reviews of the stanley barrel that's my memory

596
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,800
today and it's always been my model what is that i can do anything for the

597
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,839
customers yes a skip button we shall have

598
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:51,040
wait we have a skip button now you have a second here it is go ahead

599
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,200
and give it a shot i'll pop you forward in time so that the second my incessant

600
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,680
droning starts to bore you with just the push of a button you'll have zip right

601
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,760
past it it's what the players have been asking for i'm very proud to have

602
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,240
delivered no more listening to me rambling on and on and on no no no no

603
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,800
the stanley parable is a game for the people and if the people want silence

604
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,319
then by goodness that's what they're going to get well then sit around

605
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:20,640
waiting for me to shut up go ahead and make me shut up here we'll pretend that

606
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,359
i've just begun an intern listen to it and it goes something like this

607
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:29,520
the story and the choices or what have you can i just listen to it by becoming

608
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,880
it is so on and so forth until inevitably we all until the end of time

609
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,880
at which time everything rolled once so now you see blah blah blah

610
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,160
we've eaten too much and it can't be just yet no no until

611
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,520
245 that the logic of elimination working backwards the deduction

612
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,640
therefore becomes impossible to manufacture it went on for nearly 10 000

613
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,119
years until just yesterday oh my god you are this is like a filibuster what the

614
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:04,000
heck ah it's the only thing there is okay

615
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,559
okay okay i get it but i don't want to skip

616
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,280
i

617
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,720
once so now you see he just skipped back he just he just went back i have to skip

618
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,200
him too much and he comes he's saying everything again

619
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,160
until 245 that the logic

620
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,240
i kind of had to back you see you were only frozen in time for a few minutes

621
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,240
but it was plenty of time for me to deliver a long rambling monologue full

622
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,880
of unnecessary verbal flourishes and lengthy ruminations on the nature of

623
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,000
choice in video games of course i happen to believe it was perhaps one of my more

624
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
profound such ruminations not that of course you need a description of it but

625
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,559
if i had to

626
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,880
oh well there's sport you really did catch me rambling on it didn't you but

627
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,319
that's the power of the button the minute i start to go off on a

628
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,680
thoughtless display of self-absorption it's

629
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,520
okay welcome back stanley i should say that the amount of time the button has

630
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,480
been skipping through is becoming longer and longer that last one was well i want

631
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:25,280
to say maybe 30 45 minutes it's not unendurable by any means but it's

632
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,839
stanley stanley stanley please don't push the button again it's been 12

633
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:35,280
hours you've just been frozen there i don't know why the skips are getting

634
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,440
longer but they're really truly getting again my god

635
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:45,200
oh stanley you're back what you're back oh my goodness i have someone to talk to

636
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,720
again stanley i i think it's been a week for two weeks

637
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,200
i've been sitting here all that time just sitting here not a single person to

638
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,800
speak with and you'd think that's sad just how it's always oh that's so sad me

639
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:07,040
talking and you saying nothing um i'm good i'll see you in like a month

640

00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,200

00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,440

656
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,160

is that the fire alarm

659
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,720
i think that's a fire alarm but they didn't understand the game was never

660
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,480
meant to be funny it was meant to have a point it was meant to speak to the human

661
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,720
condition but where are they where are the jokes they bemoan they screamed they

662
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,520

738
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:42,079

740
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,280

741
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,079
anybody would be uh convinced

742
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:05,359
and they used uh some my favorite colors blue and pink so oh good you notice my

743
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:10,720
sign yes i have something very exciting to see

744
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:18,160
okay was it this time where is he kidnapping me now till

745
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,839
two now

746
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,319
more elevators huh you see stanley i've been reflecting

747
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:35,799
on the stanley parable oh my gosh shut up about the stanley parable just let me

748
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,720
i say we take it one step even further which is why i'm very proud to announce

749
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:56,240
for the first time ever the stanley parable

750
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:01,200
huh [Music]

751
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,920
yes you see isn't this far superior to a measly re-release with a few minor

752
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,400
additions think of all the new territory we'll cover with a fully fledged sequel

753
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,640
an entirely new experience built from the ground up why there is so many

754
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,480
possibilities he could go in so many different directions

755
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:23,760
this is what fans have truly been asking for

756
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,599
what does it say

757
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:30,480
do

758
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:39,200
oh that's just two right yeah taste the sequel

759
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,240
new and tasty

760
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,240
how tasty is it calling it the stanley parable 2 is just so much catchier than

761
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:53,599
ultra deluxe don't you think ultra ducks what does it even mean it's like when

762
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:58,160
you get an ultra deluxe hamburger cheeseburger it's an artistic statement

763
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,160
that's why i thought it's like a future better cheeseburger it screams progress

764
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,960
and innovation and long-term franchising potential

765
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,559
it's like uh it's like the same cheeseburger right but now it has like

766
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:17,039
another uh burger patty you probably put like more cheese on it maybe uh maybe a

767
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:22,079
fried egg and uh maybe like some bacon on it too

768
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:26,880
and uh maybe the buns aren't like regular buns now they're like sesame

769
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:32,240
seed buns and you also have like you know uh curly fries will fit too and you

770
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:37,359
have like um you know truffle aioli to dip it in and then you have a chocolate

771
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:42,000
milkshake to drink with it so that's like yeah right

772
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,400
right something like that ultra deluxe

773
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,720
they're back two doors oh no pt

774
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:57,039
oh no that's just part two whenever i see pt it gets me excited i just

775
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:02,160
reminded remember [ __ ] um silent hill pt

776
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:07,039
e let's say e4 e

777
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,240
e what does that mean

778
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,480
e

779
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:19,520
click to add speaker nuts this presentation is terrible

780
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,720
i don't even see the projector where's the projector unless it's one of those

781
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:27,000
screens that doesn't have a projector it's just like oh yeah it isn't okay

782
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,359
[Music] i just shows up on it

783
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:36,400
e now to be clear i haven't quite nailed down what exactly the stanley parable 2

784
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,839
is going to be but let's take a look at some of the features i've been

785
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:44,240
developing for it i think that if i can loosely organize a

786
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,640
handful of interesting concepts that surely the game will sort of naturally

787
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,750
spring up around them it'll all work it took the red marker with me

788
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:56,400
[Laughter] magic than anything scientific or

789
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,480
logical really oh i didn't even pay attention to what

790
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,720
you were saying what the [ __ ] why is this

791
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,559
you know the way they draw the two is like the way i feel like i drew

792
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:12,079
[ __ ] random letters and numbers when i was in like elementary school

793
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:16,720
damn what a baller move who took the red marker me

794
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,839
it was me

795
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:27,520
that's like albon knox energy what's this the roman numeral 2 every

796
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:35,200
pause button is a roman numeral too i i i i guess right kind of this way to

797
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,760
a show floor

798
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,520
this looks so ominous though i want to go down the ominous hallway

799
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:47,119
like which way would you want to go down this creepy ass hallway or over

800
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:51,920
here into the expo hall this looks like more of my kind of vibes

801
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,079
can i crouch in there no no it really doesn't let me it just

802
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,559
blocks me off

803
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,000
but i want to see what's down the creepy hallway

804
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,520
it's my horror instincts kicking in

805
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,640
the bus is here

806
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,680
man i haven't been to an expo or con in a while

807
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,480
maybe someday

808
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:24,480
here we are go on try out some of the new features

809
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:30,160
the button that says the name of the player that is playing the game

810
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,599
hear your name in the game

811
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:42,079
for the stanley parable 2 i asked myself what do players really want and of

812
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:48,160
course the first too big too small just right individually recognized and

813
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:52,400
validated as people so with that in mind my first addition

814
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:57,920
to the game is this button which speaks the name of the person playing the game

815
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,280
isn't that wonderful

816
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:09,440
what i should have clarified right now the button only says the name jim but of

817
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,240
course in the final game this button will say your name whatever name that is

818
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:18,719
here let's have you role players gym to really simulate the full experience i'm

819
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:24,000
not a gem just play along okay sorry it's all the gems out there

820
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,199
my bad but okay here we go let's take a deep breath jim in your mind forget

821
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:33,359
whoever you are and simply become a person named jim

822
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:39,440
i want you to imagine yourself living as jim sleeping and wakings oh hell no i'm

823
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,920
not i'm not being i'm not waking up as a gym

824
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,880
seizing all of the world's [ __ ] that's it

825
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,799
and as jim watching your dreams crumble into dust

826
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:54,799
do you feel it deeply are you really truly gym right now if so then please

827
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:59,120
step forward and press the button and just have my have my dreams crumble like

828
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:03,440
jim oh i'm sorry it's all the gyms out there your dreams are crumbling right

829
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:09,279
now yes you'll see what a thrill what a rush

830
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,120
that was you the button that was me

831
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:17,279
oh it's you no it's not i'm not jim i want to hear

832
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:22,239
to say gym it again even harder the second time if

833
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:26,239
this were the only new feature in the stanley parable 2 it would still be

834
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:30,480
worth the money let's take a break from the gym button i'm too emotionally

835
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,560
drained from all of this personal validation

836
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,480
he's acting like it's uh i'm hitting his g spot you know it's like when i press

837
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:43,839
the button he's like oh ah it's time for f oh there cowboy

838
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:48,880
sometimes the person can be too much jim i'm putting the gym button away

839
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:55,520
otherwise soon i'll start to make all sense of who you actually are no

840
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,520
he took away my button he really said he really confiscated

841
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,840
from me he said no more it's gone now you don't have any more

842
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,440
gym button rights okay i really like the button though maybe i

843
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:16,760
am jim i am now jim jimmy neutron i'm jimmy neutron

844
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,560
i just got to get a big brain and a friend named carl weiser

845
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,880
he was attracted to my mom right that's how that's how the show

846
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,640
went i think you

847
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,640
named jim to play the stanley parable too that would actually save me the work

848
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,760
of finishing this feature

849
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:43,440
infinite holes oh infinite holes oh my god that sounds like an amazing

850
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:48,239
merchandise idea i want infinite holes

851
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:51,760
for life epilogue oh wait hold on before i go in

852
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:58,360
there i'm gonna look around here merch oh they even have a merch stand

853
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:05,520
there's a qr code up there what the heck okay

854
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:13,480
free merch the reassurance bucket please no screenshots

855
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:21,280
uh hold on i want to take a look what's the reassurance bucket hello

856
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,400
a common complaint of the stanley parable was that it was confusing and

857
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:31,440
paradoxical that it engendered a chaotic sense of reckless despair in those who

858
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,640
bought it well i'm happy to say that after much

859
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:39,600
consideration i've engineered a clever solution to this fundamental problem

860
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:44,159
with the game it's the stanley parable reassurance

861
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:48,800
bucket is it my [ __ ] bucket anytime you're holding the bucket a sense of

862
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,360
calm and ease will fill your mind and your heart it's true

863
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:57,920
as long as you hold on to the bucket the many disorienting contradictions of the

864
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:03,360
stanley parable will feel perfectly normal and perhaps even comforting

865
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,960
you may even come to long for the gentle embracing

866
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,920
cognitive dissonance while the bucket is in your arms and to be honest it's a

867
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,920
much more convenient i can't grab the bucket me than actually redesigning the

868
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,760
game to be less uncomfortable can you imagine what a pain in the ass that

869
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:26,000
would be yes the bucket is the perfect solution come on and give it a try the

870
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,400
chum bucket you got the chum bucket in the [ __ ] bucket

871
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:35,199
i just [Laughter]

872
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:39,440
can you feel it the glow of comfort even in the face of

873
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,320
crushing despair must already be sweeping through your body anymore

874
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,719
can i say that i do believe the bucket lends you an air of charisma as well

875
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:52,480
it's just a bucket just holding it has made you the slightest bit more

876
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:56,400
attractive as a person ah the benefits of the bucket seem to go

877
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:02,080
on and on don't they what all this and more awaits you in the stanley parable

878
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:06,560
too he laughed at me he was like

879
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,480

the jump circle the infinite holes i want to see this infinite hole you're

903
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:57,239
talking about more holes

904
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:01,040
yeah i'm really dude i'm really i'm just stuck with this bucket by the way

905
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:05,280
okay i'll be honest i haven't yet decided on this one i think that in the

906
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:10,320
new version the office could use a bit of decoration like balloons but i

907
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:16,880
undecided on get well someday and happy 12th birthday which would you go with

908
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:22,159
get well someday or happy 12th birthday stephanie's

909
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:28,400
wait what is this for huh get well sunday heart

910
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,679
wait i like this one

911
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:35,280

step bro yeah well someday

914
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:49,840
i like i like the passive aggressiveness about this one right because you can

915
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,719
take it you can take it as a bad contact so you also like taking a good way so

916
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:59,040
i'll do that sometimes when you solicit another person's opinion it makes you

917
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:04,239
realize that you knew which one you actually really wanted all along happy

918
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:09,360
12th birthday step nice it is what

919
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:17,360
oh okay or actually maybe i should have gone with no no i've

920
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:22,640
made my decision we're moving on come now you've already made your choice it's

921
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:28,400
true that you chose badly that we all have to move on from our mistakes

922
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:32,960
he he gave me the the choice to pick one

923
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,400
and then he said no you're wrong

924
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:41,040
he said i was wrong wow okay

925
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:44,239
the illusion of choice

926
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:50,880
time and depth oh no this is too big brain for me sorry

927
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:56,800
i don't understand infinity whole entrance

928
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,199
more holes more holes it just keeps going more

929
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:06,239
there's more there's a lot of holes are there also plot holes

930
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:10,400
as well stanley here's an idea that i'm truly fond of it's never been done

931
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:16,159
before in a video game this is in fact a hole that you can fall down forever

932
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:22,080
that's right infinite falling you can fall until the end of time if you like a

933
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:25,040
stunning leap forward for video games is a medium

934
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,760
infinite hole oh that's a deep hole

935
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,199
that's a really deep hole there

936
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,880
do we do you guys want to go inside the hole

937
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,239
do we want to go inside the hole

938
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,120
it's really something to jump inside the hole

939
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:47,280
what if it's just a drawing of a hole it's not really a hole

940
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,000
oh it's a hole

941
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:57,280
you see isn't it wonderful one of my more ingenious concoctions if i do say

942
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:02,560
oh my god now then since you've gotten to see the infinite hole you can press

943
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,120
the teleport button to pop back up to the top what's that button

944
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:12,640
i'll press g to return to the surface what if i just wanna now i don't mean to

945
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,719
be a bummer but i do recommend you use the teleport button to go back to the

946
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:21,360
top why maybe do it on the sooner rather than later spectrum of things you said

947
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:26,719
it was an endless hole right so i should be fine right

948
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:29,760
right okay stanley i don't know quite how to

949
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,239
say this tactfully but it's possible that i slightly exaggerated the infinite

950
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:38,080
nature of the hole is it a very very deep hole to be

951
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,520
certain it is it's an extremely deep

952
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:46,320
i don't want anyone to say that it isn't an astonishingly deep hole it is is it

953
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,280
infinite well that sort of depends on your

954
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:53,920
definition of infinity from one perspective the infinite is merely

955
01:18:53,920 --> 01:19:00,320
philosophical in nature it's more of a oh okay well good for you you found the

956
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,800
bottom where i didn't die you found me out stanley i'm a liar and cheat and

957
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:10,080
you're so clever look i think the issue here is just that you're unusually

958
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:14,239
fascinated by falling what normal person actually wants to

959
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:18,960
fall infinitely i figured the hurl was as deep as anyone would actually need

960
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:23,520
don't you put this on me maybe you're the problem

961
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,520
i didn't even do anything there he he got so upset at me for nothing i just

962
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:31,120
want to fall in the hole why didn't we just put all this i have a

963
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:35,120
need to fill holes sometimes you just want to go down the

964
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,480
hole explore the hole see what's down the hole find out what's at the end of

965
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,679
the hole button to warp up to the top of the hole

966
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:46,400
and we can move on i'll just be up here when you're ready

967
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:50,880
no i'm sitting down here i'm sitting at the bottom of the well with my bucket in

968
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,640
this hole now you can't tell me what to do

969
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:04,400
[Music] yup just me and my bucket

01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:24,000
300 000 feet down below surviving here my name's my name is jim apparently

damn i'm at the i'm at the far bottom of this [ __ ] dude

976
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,520
that's kind of ironic don't you think

977
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,920
look at the bottom of the hole

978
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,679
huh huh

979
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:50,159

i don't like that at all we're gonna we're gonna get the [ __ ] out

981
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:59,040
of here i i great now i'm very excited to show you even more of my ideas for

982
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:03,360
the sequel oh for heaven

983
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,480
i was right the problem is you it's not me the

984
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:11,520
problem is that you like holes too much not normal

985
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,719
would have said yep that's an infinite hole right there goes on forever till

986
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:19,600
the end of time don't need to see it all but not you oh no no no no you have a

987
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,120
weird sort of oh

988
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,679
did the hole seem even shorter to you this time no help it feel like you spent

989
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:32,719
a little less time in there than you did before he knows man he [ __ ] knows i

990
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,920
like holes too much

991
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:41,280
that's okay down he got me i mean admittedly i didn't make an infinite

992
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:45,679
hole but i didn't think it was that not infinite well i suppose once again

993
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:49,440
there's nothing to do here if you decide you've had enough of the hole you can

994
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:54,560
hit the teleport button and come join me up i want more hole give me more hole

995
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:59,840
had enough i'm positively thrilled gosh how could i have guessed you're back in

996
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,760
the hole if this starts to become a thing where

997
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:08,400
it's so small okay yeah wait why is this whole so small now

998
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,880
extremely certain that the whole is not only not infinite but that it's growing

999
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,960
steadily less and less infinite why are you suspecting what i'm starting to hit

1000
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,520
the point where it's no longer feasible to call the hole infinitely deep even by

1001
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,960
the lacks overall standards for accountability and marketing what's

1002
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:29,040
going on here stanley i have no explanation for the i

1003
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:34,080
want to keep falling here let's try something let's pop back

1004
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:37,600
up to the top and we'll see if it gets any shorter

1005
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,960
well there's sure game of my life how is this still

1006
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,639
appealing to you i know you're obsessed with holes but at

1007
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:48,320
this depth i just can't see this scratching the itch

1008
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:51,120
oh who am i to judge

1009
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:55,440
you just do whatever it is you're here to do and hit the teleport button when

1010
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:59,120
you're ready to move on press g to return to a surface why can't

1011
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,840
i just jump up

1012
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,040
hmm is the um

1013
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:09,120
teleport button not working you better

1014
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,480
well i mean i really don't have an explanation it

1015
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:16,080
was working just a moment ago

1016
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,400
i'm stuck i'm actually stuck

1017
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,199
no there is one thing i can do to fix this

1018
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:27,760
i'm out goodbye stanley you couldn't bear to be away from the hole and now

1019
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,000
you'll get more time with it than you could ever have asked for it's a win for

1020
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,840
everyone you get to be with the whole i get to do literally anything else

1021
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,639

1026
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,040
it feels kind of like a you know like a metaphor

1027
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,440
right it's kind of like a metaphor in a way

1028
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:10,800

1122
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:55,920
stanley parable 2 you'll run around gathering up these miniature stanley

1123
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,800
figurines so thank you thank you for that is that there will be no reward for

1124
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:05,199
collecting all of them i don't want to stifle the intrinsic joy of watching a

1125
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:09,520
number go up you simply collect all of them and then you move the hell on with

1126
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,280
your unremarkable life ah

1130
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,440
everything in a video game and then they give you a big fancy reward for it

1131
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:32,080

stanley oh what do you think do you like all of the new features this is okay i

1173
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:56,560
like the whole clear yet how exactly these features will come together as one

1174
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:01,440
the whole is the best part of video game but i can feel it in my soul it's going

1175
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:06,239
to work there's definitely a good game in there somewhere say let's do an

1176
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:10,880
experiment i'll arrange these new features together and we'll see whether

1177
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:15,060
or not it coheres into a meaningful gameplay experience

1178
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:18,880
[Music] okay

1179
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,800
are you ready here it is i give you

1180
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:28,320
the stanley parable two [Music]

1181
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,119
what that's it

1182
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:34,560
um well um i mean there's potential here

1183
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:39,360
right it's sort of okay never mind hold on let me do a different

1184
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:44,400
arrangement okay yes yes this is much better i feel

1185
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:48,960
good here we go i want i want a new hole

1186
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,280
oh

1187
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,520
wait the skip button oh no that's a gym button this isn't a coherent video game

1188
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:59,840
at all it's a lot of gags and i do very much enjoy creating gags

1189
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:04,719
but they don't add up to anything i wanted more than anything to create a

1190
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:10,000
sequel that would capture all the magic of the first game i wanted fans to love

1191
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,760
it no matter how good these gags are they wouldn't stand on their own they

1192
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,119
would need the structure in the gameplay of the original

1193
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:19,760
wait maybe that's it

1194
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,679
i can take the original stanley parable uh-huh

1195
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:28,880
insert a few of my new features into it peacefully of course

1196
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:33,040
with care for the vision and integrity of the original game

1197
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:36,639
would it possibly work i suppose it could but it would need a

1198
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:42,280
really really tremendous title screen a title screen that says with bold and

1199
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:48,400
uncompromising conviction this is the stanley parable too

1200
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:52,159
let me see if i can whip something up [Music]

1201
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:54,480
perfect go ahead

1202
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:57,880
take a look

1203
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:01,920
wow he actually did it

1204
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,239
the settings even look better too

1205
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:09,119
that's crazy okay

1206
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:13,600
i click anything anything else everything's red

1207
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:17,360
are we sure this isn't gonna be a horror game

1208
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:23,679
this is the story of a man named stanley no

1209
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:26,960
stanley work oh no

1210
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:36,130
[Music]

1211
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:41,600
it looks the exact same i don't want the i don't want the

1212
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:47,520
stephanie's [ __ ] uh balloons were gone what could it mean

1213
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:51,199
so don't wanted to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed a memo

1214
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:57,520
i'm stuck i'm stuck in an endless loop i'm gonna go crazy man you felt the

1215
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:04,159
bucket calling to him begging him to pick it up why why was he not doing it

1216
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:12,000
stanley felt the bucket calling to him do i pick it up

1217
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,080
why do i why do i why does it want me to pick up the bucket so bad

1218
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:20,639
what if i just ignore the bucket huh what if i just ignore the bucket

1219
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:23,840

the bucket yeah i did i did pick up the bucket damn

1223
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:41,600
bro that's that's noteworthy the bucket is back

1224
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,920
stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest and entered the door on his

1225
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:49,199
left he's making me seem so crazy like what's

1226
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:51,760
the deal with the bucket what's the bucket for

1227
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:57,679
is there like something game changing about this [ __ ] bucket

1228
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:02,239
let's go to the right this was not the correct way to the meeting room but

1229
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:06,960
stanley had felt the bucket calling to him telling him that the employee lounge

1230
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:11,600
was simply the place to be why is the bucket telling me what it

1231
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:16,960
and here it was had the bucket turned out to be correct well no never mind the

1232
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:21,119
bucket was wrong stanley took the door on his left to go

1233
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:24,159
back to the meeting no

1234
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:28,639
no said the bucket don't go to the meeting

1235
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:36,000
room go somewhere else the cargo lift yes go there go to the cargo lift

1236
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:41,960
it sounds like mister the bucket

1237
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:58,560
[Laughter] why did i think of him i don't know

1238
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:04,080
oh god oh my god what good said the bucket now ride the lift all the way to

1239
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:07,600
the top there's something up there i need you to do

1240
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:11,199
stanley did not question why or how this bucket was speaking to you this isn't

1241
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:13,920
between you of course because don't tell him this

1242
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:17,920
between me and you guys stanley chose not to think about this obvious fact he

1243
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:22,400
was firmly convinced that the bucket had to go down here and he unthinkingly did

1244
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:27,600
whatever the bucket asked no i'm not obeying the bucket i'm going

1245
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:33,360
to go down here go down here with the bucket

1246
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:36,239
oh this is new

1247
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:41,040
no stop look there on the wall you see there's a sign right there it says no

1248
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:45,360
buckets past this point stanley how could you think it was okay to bring the

1249
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:48,960
bucket here unless what if the problem is that you actually

1250
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:53,040
don't know what is a bucket and what isn't a bucket i suppose that would

1251
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:57,840
explain a lot about your behavior up to this point which if that's true well my

1252
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:00,639
goodness what is this bucket

1253
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:05,760
like this misunderstanding could have dire consequences entire rest of the

1254
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,560
game if not addressed quickly and properly

1255
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:13,280
so much of the impact of the story is dependent on your understanding of what

1256
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:19,199
is and isn't a bucket i know what about you step in here for a moment

1257
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:22,320
oh man you want me to walk in there you want to walk inside there why can't you

1258
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:27,679
just go in here what's wrong with the bucket doesn't let me bring onion inside

1259
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:34,800
is this a bucket he really thinks i'm stupid doesn't he

1260
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:38,719
now then i really think i don't know what a bucket is some test scenarios and

1261
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:43,199
you'll tell me whether or not the thing i'm showing you is a bucket okay surely

1262
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:46,400
enough right they should tell us everything easy ever need to know you

1263
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:50,000
can do this or is not a bucket

1264
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,480

01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:32,480
you know what i'm too confused to even sort it out

1312
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:36,639
i've lost all sense of perspective what is a bucket what isn't the bucket i

1313
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:40,560
think you're crazy i could answer these questions with confidence and yet now

1314
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:44,800
i'm somewhat adrift i want to get out of here any of us know what a bucket is

1315
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:50,480
am i a bucket no you're not a bucket stanley i can't keep doing this i'm

1316
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:54,320
losing myself and myself was all i ever had to begin with

1317
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:58,880
i'm afraid the bucket is threatening to tear our relationship apart i can't have

1318
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:07,119
that i'm sorry but i'm going to erase all no aim entirely okay no

1319
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:14,400
it's a he took a whole bucket what happened is everything gone why

1320
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:18,480
didn't everything disappear wait was everything a bucket

1321
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:21,040
every single thing in the game was a bucket

1322
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:25,760
oh my god i had no idea wow you're a funny guy except me

1323
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:31,119
i'm not a bucket after all a new stanley you're still here you're not a bucket

1324
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:35,360
either oh this is wonderful news we're not buckets

1325
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:39,679
yes i actually feel much more at ease right now it's delightful to get some

1326
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:43,440
clarity on that issue but it doesn't change the fact that we haven't got a

1327
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:47,119
game so tell you what uh-huh i'll reset

1328
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:51,920
everything and we'll put back all of the buckets okay okay and we'll know that

1329
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:56,880
it's all a bucket but if you run into anyone else maybe don't mention that who

1330
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:02,239
knows what that information might do to a person all right here we go

1331
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:07,199
i am losing my mind i can't believe it

1332
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:12,000
everything's a bucket every everything's a bucket everything's a

1333
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,840
[ __ ] it oh man

1334
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,719
bro

1335
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:27,440
but he took away the bucket do i get it back though if i go back to the same

1336
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:31,280
spot because we're gone all of these co-workers were gone

1337
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:34,400
they decided to go to the meeting room give me that pocket he lifted the bucket

1338
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:38,800
into his arms and a wave of comfort rushed over him in that [ __ ] bucket

1339
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:42,320
it's my bucket stanley clutched the bucket tightly to

1340
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:45,520
his chest this was not the correct way to the meeting room yeah you're damn

1341
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:49,760
right it isn't felt the bucket calling to him telling him that the employee

1342
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:54,880
lounge was simply the place to be and here it was had the bucket turned

1343
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:58,880
out to be correct was this no you know why i just noticed i just

1344
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:03,920
noticed something i completely forgot to turn off the uh hold on give me a second

1345
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:08,159
oh my god i can't believe it

1346
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:11,840
this whole time i had my my thing was like a little

1347
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:15,679
darker than it should have been i am bright again hi manny took the door

1348
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:19,040
on his left back

1349
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:27,040
sorry i had like a filter on a little filter on non-brighter now

1350
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:32,159
save the bucket don't go to the meeting room go somewhere else find a cargo lift

1351
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:38,880
yes go there go to the cargo lift guys it doesn't it sound does it not or

1352
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:42,400
it sound like miss though come on it's pretty it's pretty close i like that

1353
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:46,960
good said the bucket now ride the lift all the way to the top there's something

1354
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:52,960
up there i need you to do actually you kind of can kind of feel

1355
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,000
but stanley chose not to think about this obvious fact he was firmly

1356
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,480
convinced that the bucket had spoken to him and he unthinkingly did whatever the

1357
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:10,080
[ __ ] it asked oh my god i'm so i'm sorry

1358
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:15,520
i'm so sorry in here said the bucket go into this dark room over here uh-huh

1359
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:20,400
danny once again obeyed blindly go into the dark room over here what

1360
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:24,639
dark room huh there's a dark room this one

1361
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:35,760
oh now pick up the phone said the bucket no

1362
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:40,000
whoa hold on why did you unplug the phone

1363
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,800
were you trying to resist the bucket's orders stanley i was joking obviously

1364
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:49,119
the bucket isn't talking to you and telling you to do things buckets can't

1365
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:54,400
talk it was a joke don't you get the joke it's funny stammy a talking bucket

1366
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:57,679
ah can't you see um oh goodness i must have

1367
01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:01,199
really bungled up the delivery if you actually took me seriously where did i

1368
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:04,880
mess up the joke should i have paused for longer or

1369
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:09,440
spoken quicker comedic timing is so difficult i wish i

1370
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:13,760
were better at it but there isn't exactly an instructional video on comedy

1371
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:16,960
that one can watch to fully oh wait yes there is

1372
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:20,880
um it's sitting right here let's take a look what

1373
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:25,520
but but wait no no what what is comedic timing

1374
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:32,080
what is what is comedic timing timing how does it work how long should it last

1375
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:36,639
how can it be used to effectively silence your political enemies and more

1376
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:41,040
importantly can it be taught in its entirety within 90 seconds

1377
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:44,480
thankfully the answer to all of these questions is

1378
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:48,159
yes let's dive deeper i'm so confused if

1379
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:52,639
you've ever told a kid or made someone laugh in all likelihood you did it while

1380
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:58,159
standing 50 to 80 centimeters from them in a room of no more than 76 degrees

1381
01:52:58,159 --> 01:53:03,040
fahrenheit with one of your arms raised straight upward at a 15 degree angle

1382
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:06,800
from your body these are the optimal conditions for

1383
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:10,960
good comedic timing to begin the joke huh start by stating

1384
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:14,880
and spelling your name next

1385
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:19,040
joke including the specific times at which the recipient of the joke will

1386
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:23,360
laugh and then spell out your name a second time

1387
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:27,599
with these steps complete it's time to begin the humor

1388
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:33,760
speak the entire joke in no more than 18 seconds and no less than 13 and a half

1389
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:37,360
pausing only for bathroom breaks when necessary

1390
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:41,440
when the joke has concluded it is customary to inform your listener that

1391
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:45,520
the joke is over by declaring in your loudest possible voice

1392
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:48,480
i'm dunny with the funny

1393
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:54,000
let's practice screaming i'm danny with the funny now

1394
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:58,159
i'm donny with the funny good

1395
01:53:58,159 --> 01:54:02,480
this saying is a perfect example of expectations management which is the

1396
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:06,800
cornerstone of good comedy this is all a joke to you finally it's time to hand

1397
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:11,520
out surveys collecting hard data from your audience on how rap they were

1398
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:15,360
throughout the joke is the only way to grow or learn as a comedian

1399
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:19,840
an effective survey should be no less than 10 pages long and should include

1400
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:22,560
the same question reprinted several times

1401
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:26,639
just to ensure the survey taker is actually paying attention and not simply

1402
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:30,480
filling in answers at random and that's all there is with these

1403
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:35,360
strategies at your disposal you'll have audiences doubled over in latter and

1404
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:38,800
even triple over and laughter in no time at all

1405
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:43,119
just remember to let them stop laughing at some point you gut-busting little

1406
01:54:43,119 --> 01:54:46,800
scamp after all you've got busting the front

1407
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:51,520
lines of the war to fight the 12-legged invaders who threaten our very existence

1408
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:56,400
and very likely die in a hailstorm of bullets and mandibles all of us must be

1409
01:54:56,400 --> 01:55:00,719
prepared to give our lives to this noble course just as our children must do

1410
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:08,800
after us and their children after them godspeed and made earth reign supreme

1411
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:13,119
this feels like an analog horror hey what was that this video is a little

1412
01:55:13,119 --> 01:55:17,599
outdated isn't it well no matter i think the fundamentals of proper comedic

1413
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:22,080
timing are still as relevant today as they were back then so with that in mind

1414
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:26,880
i believe the only way forward is for us to return to the two doors and walk

1415
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:31,520
through all of this again so i can try telling my story with more appropriate

1416
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:36,400
comedic delivery come along let's head back uh

1417
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:42,159
so apparently okay i don't know how comedic timing has to deal with like

1418
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:47,360
fending off the alien invaders but okay

1419
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:52,159
sure yeah let's let's let's say yeah that will work

1420
01:55:52,159 --> 01:55:56,719
there's aliens i love aliens man

1421
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:02,159
oh my god what is happening man like i still don't understand what's going on

1422
01:56:02,159 --> 01:56:05,599
in this game like there i don't know how to explain

1423
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:10,400
what what the [ __ ] is happening what's going on

1424
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:14,800
i can feel i want my talking bucket back i'm really going to nail the delivery

1425
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:19,840
you'll be in stitches a talking bucket you'll say how ridiculous how absurd

1426
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:25,520
what a hilarious concept the king of comedy that's what you'll call me thank

1427
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:30,000
goodness we have the instructional video otherwise who knows where we'd be right

1428
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,480
now well i wouldn't be the king of comedy

1429
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:37,280
that's for sure the bucket spoke to stanley hmm

1430
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:41,280
the bucket spoke the bucket spoke

1431
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:45,679
oh i'll figure it out on the fly no need to go over there

1432
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:49,440
um man he does good he does a good miss the

1433
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:52,880
voice like i'm jealous

1434
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:57,679
okay i kind of miss it you know i think i think i actually just miss him i think

1435
01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:01,360
that's why it's going on i think i just miss him do not lie if you're lying

1436
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:06,280
right now stop okay i'll stop lying

1437
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:20,229
[Music]

1438
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:26,719
ah i'm gonna kick this bucket across the room

1439
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:30,880
no i want so i won't do that you're precious here we go you ready

1440
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:34,480
when stanley and the bucket came to a set of two open doors and the bucket

1441
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:38,960
entered the door on the left yeah

1442
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:42,000
left right left

1443
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,199
right left right left

1444
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:50,639
right we're going to darkness now

1445
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:54,800
we're back at the phone already no no what's going on there was supposed

1446
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:59,119
to be several rooms leading up to this there was supposed to be a build up to

1447
01:57:59,119 --> 01:58:03,520
this point a dramatic display of remarkable comedic wit which culminates

1448
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:08,000
in this scene with the phone but now the timing's completely off

1449
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,480
the joke will never land well not the way it was meant to and it's all my

1450
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:16,080
fault i must have forgotten that the phone room comes immediately after the

1451
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:19,599
two-door's room what an egregious mistake

1452
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:23,840
i've made a fool of myself i don't know is it was this supposed to be funny i'm

1453
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,119
nothing i'm not even the lowliest joke telling

1454
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:30,080
will i think

1455
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:35,280
i think i need no no we do not need to watch the video again no no no no no no

1456
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:39,840
no no no no no i don't want to watch it that will help me improve my

1457
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:43,599
no please i don't want to watch the video again here we go oh you ready

1458
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:47,599
when stanley and the bucket came to a set of two open doors they entered the

1459
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:52,000
door on the left right

1460
01:58:57,199 --> 01:59:00,800
we're back at the phone already

1461
01:59:01,119 --> 01:59:04,960
oh he doesn't like me here we go you ready

1462
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:08,960
when stanley and the bucket came to a set of two open doors they entered the

1463
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:14,560
door on the left bro wait hold on like

1464
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,400
okay i guess i it doesn't really let me go to the right so i guess i just gotta

1465
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:21,599
go to the left you were supposed to go through the door on the right leading

1466
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:25,280
way to the phone not even look at the instructional video

1467
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:30,639
i think this is all covered very clearly oh you're such a comedic timing work now

1468
01:59:30,639 --> 01:59:35,119
it's done the joke is completely down and over it's all there is never a joke

1469
01:59:35,119 --> 01:59:40,000

1473
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:13,360

1474
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:21,840

1475
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:26,880

1484
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:03,360
how about that how about that i can't wait to tell this story to my co-workers

1485
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:07,599
stanley thought what story using they'll find it oh won't we all just laugh and

1486
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:12,159
laugh at the time i thought everyone had gone missing

1487
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:15,599
i'm not grabbing the bucket

1488
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:22,960
i'm not grabbing the bucket when stanley came to a set of two open

1489
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:27,199
doors he entered the door on his left

1490
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:34,239
i'll grab him next time i want to see if uh you know he he does anything

1491
02:01:34,239 --> 02:01:37,440
yet there was not a single person here either

1492
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:42,800
feeling a wave of disbelief stanley decided to go up to his bosses

1493
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:48,239
left you guys behind upstairs to his boss's office

1494
02:01:48,239 --> 02:01:51,840
no i want to go downstairs again

1495
02:01:52,239 --> 02:01:54,880
oh you found one of them one of the

1496
02:01:54,880 --> 02:02:00,080
miniature stanley figurines remember no reward for collecting all of these only

1497
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:05,119
the intrinsic pleasure of a job well done you can't buy that sort of fabulous

1498
02:02:05,119 --> 02:02:09,520
stanley god knows that tribe ah

1499
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:15,280

1500
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:19,280
ah why am i here again stanley just

1501
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:22,400
couldn't do it he considered the possibility of facing

1502
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:27,360
his boss admitting he had left his post during work hours he might be fired for

1503
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:31,679
that and in such a way this is the same ending hold on wait i [ __ ] up hold on

1506
02:02:40,239 --> 02:02:43,360

02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:47,840

1508
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:52,239
away as stanley embraced the bucket yeah

1509
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:56,320
stanley clutched the bucket tightened into his chest and entered the door on

1510
02:02:56,320 --> 02:03:02,560
his left i kissed the bucket is my bucket

1511
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,920
wait what wait what is this

1512
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:12,639

1513
02:03:12,639 --> 02:03:14,960
all huh

1514
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:17,760
that's creepy

1515
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:21,360
the mission status alar oh

1516
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:26,080
a large room lots of boxes somewhere both red and blue nearby a fireplace a

1517
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:30,400
private but smelly place for an important person

1518
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:35,280
oh is to collect all the collectibles

1519
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:39,760
stalking yourselves there will be a cleaning of this wall

1520
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:44,560
required who are you 666 lol

1521
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:46,880
what

1522
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:52,000
they they really want me to go look for it okay you know what fine fine i will i

1523
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:55,360
will go look for the collectors coming to a staircase stanley and the bucket

1524
02:03:55,360 --> 02:04:00,159
walked upstairs to the bosses what if i just take the bucket with me

1525
02:04:00,159 --> 02:04:04,000
downstairs will i change anything

1526
02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:09,440
but stanley just couldn't do it he considered the possibility of facing

1527
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:13,920
his boss admitting he had left his post during work hours he might be fired for

1528
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:19,040
that and in such a competitive economy why had he taken that risk all because

1529
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:24,320
he believed everyone had vanished his boss would think he was crazy and then

1530
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:29,760
something occurred to stanley maybe he thought to himself maybe i am

1531
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:34,400
crazy no it's the same thing down at the bucket in his arms am i crazy he asked

1532
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:38,880
the bucket the bucket returned his gaze but said nothing at all am i crazy

1533
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:42,560
buckingham stanley thought usually the bucket is a source of guidance and

1534
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:48,400
wisdom for me in difficult times such as these hey chad am i crazy it felt none

1535
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:51,199
of it's familiar am i crazy

1536
02:04:51,199 --> 02:04:56,560
and that's when stanley realized this isn't my bucket it's just a normal

1537
02:04:56,560 --> 02:05:01,280
everyday bucket someone else's bucket perhaps how did i end up with someone

1538
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:05,679
else's bucket this is all terribly wrong surely no good would

1539
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:09,520
who knows what sorts of bizarre hallucinations stanley might experience

1540
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:13,119
without the unfocused grounding presence of his bucket

1541
02:05:13,119 --> 02:05:17,360
indeed now he noticed that the rooms were repeating which was of course very

1542
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:20,320
odd now he felt himself floating off the

1543
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:24,159
ground oh gracious he exclaimed without my

1544
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:29,760
bucket i've gone truly mad where is it i must find it far off in the distance now

1545
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:35,119
he heard it calling to him stanley stanley it's me

1546
02:05:35,119 --> 02:05:38,960
the bucket could it truly be he rushed forward from

1547
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:43,360
room to room passing by one bucket after the next none of them were his none of

1548
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:50,159
them were his special bucket come to me stanley find me

1549
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:54,239
he had to return to his old friend it was the only way to truly restore his

1550
02:05:54,239 --> 02:05:58,159
sanity and then suddenly it froze dead in his tracks

1551
02:05:58,159 --> 02:06:01,679
he knew where the voice of the bucket had been coming from

1552
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:06,000
the real bucket was inside of him all along

1553
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:14,199
it was incredibly painful really stanley doubled over in agony and blacked out

1554
02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:21,679
the real bucket was inside of me of a woman named mariela huh are we really

1555
02:06:21,679 --> 02:06:24,719
gonna it's are we gonna really be passing on the

1556
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:29,520
streets again like any other die die rose got dressed picked up her bucket of

1557
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:33,119
comfort and security and walked to her place of work

1558
02:06:33,119 --> 02:06:37,760
but on this particular day her walk was interrupted by the body of a man who had

1559
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:41,760
stumbled through town talking and screaming to himself and then collapsed

1560
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:46,639
dead on the sidewalk right away she knew what the problem was

1561
02:06:46,639 --> 02:06:51,599
this man had no butt i'm bucketless no buckets

1562
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:53,920
no buckets [Music]

1563
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:58,760
all of his actions and how everything is pre-determined

1564
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:14,719
how cruel the world can be marielle and she hugged her own bucket even

1565
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:18,239
tighter but of course she had no time for this

1566
02:07:18,239 --> 02:07:22,320
there were a myriad of confusing problems she would soon have to confront

1567
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:26,400
at work for which her bucket would provide absolute guidance and total

1568
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:31,840
clarity on everything heck yes she thought to herself my life ticks ass and

1569
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:37,280
she backflipped all the way to work what a [ __ ]

1570
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:41,840
flaunting her bucket at a dead body

1571
02:07:43,599 --> 02:07:47,760
what is with the bucket man what's with all the bucket so why is the bucket so

1572
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:52,400
important oh my god oh it's right there why is it why are

1573
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:56,960
you so close to me now warmth spread through stanley's arms with the bucket

1574
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:02,079
in his arms again he was home stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest

1575
02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:05,840
and entered the door on his left

1576
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:11,119
this was not the correct way to the meeting room but stanley had felt the

1577
02:08:11,119 --> 02:08:15,920
bucket calling to him telling him that the employee lounge was simply the place

1578
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:19,199
to be and here it was had the bucket turned

1579
02:08:19,199 --> 02:08:23,360
out to be correct was this better than the meeting room yes danny thought to

1580
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:28,239
himself yes perhaps it truly oh how insightful the bucket turned out to

1581
02:08:28,239 --> 02:08:30,400
be no

1582
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:34,840
never mind wait hold on left we have to go this way what if i go this

1583
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:38,639
way left to go back and so the two of them detoured through the maintenance

1584
02:08:38,639 --> 02:08:42,800
section and walked straight ahead to the opposite way what is this

1585
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:45,679
wait what is this stuff

1586
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:51,840

my friends about you very much it's this bucket you're carrying around

1593
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:22,800
everywhere the bucket isn't even from the original

1594
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:27,599
stanley parable it's just secret am i having the ones that matter stanley

1595
02:09:27,599 --> 02:09:31,360
classic characters from the first game like the adventure line and the broom

1596
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:35,440
closet because that's what fans oh my god they're giving me an intervention

1597
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:40,000
their favorite jokes not this bucket that they've never seen before

1598
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,840
yes i know i'm the one who gave you the bucket but you're spending too much time

1599
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:48,159
with it don't you want another story involving the adventure line we could

1600
02:09:48,159 --> 02:09:52,880
make the adventure line go somewhere new yes yes that's what the fans want let's

1601
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:55,280
do it

1602
02:09:55,679 --> 02:09:59,280
but but look at that wacky line who knows where

1603
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:03,440
it'll go off to next oh and it played some silly music as well you can't take

1604
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:06,320
my bucket [Music]

1605
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:09,320
what

1606
02:10:10,730 --> 02:10:22,880
[Music] now this is what the stanley parable is

1607
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:26,960
all about don't you remember all those great jokes from the original dialogue

1608
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:31,520
also stanley is addicted to drugs and hookers

1609
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:34,800
whoa

1610
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:39,199
whoa i did not expect that

1611
02:10:39,199 --> 02:10:43,040
it's as classic knowledge it was back then let's do it for the fans stanley

1612
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:47,520
let's give them more content exactly like this but if we want to do that

1613
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:50,320
you're going to have to give something up

1614
02:10:50,320 --> 02:10:53,280
why am i have to give up

1615
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:58,400
oh my huh give up you're not gonna let me get rid of my

1616
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:03,199

1617
02:11:03,199 --> 02:11:08,400

1618
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:12,560
everything don't you get it stanley we need to get rid of the bucket

1619
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:16,639
that's why i'm very proud to introduce a brand new character

1620
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:21,119
this is the bucket destroyer

1621
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:25,199
i think it'll make a wonderful new addition to the rich lore of the stanley

1622
02:11:25,199 --> 02:11:30,320
parable true it also was not in this but it's such a well flesh i refuse with

1623
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:34,159
so much personality that to me it already feels as though it's been part

1624
02:11:34,159 --> 02:11:39,840
of the cast all along don't you agree [ __ ] is this can you guess what the

1625
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:43,199
bucket destroyer does surely you don't need me to spell it out

1626
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:46,880
for you no no i can't just say that now stanley

1627
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:51,119
say goodbye to the bucket and then pop it into the machine when you're ready no

1628
02:11:51,119 --> 02:11:56,079
i don't think i will i don't think i will i uh

1629
02:11:56,079 --> 02:12:00,400
listen to me it's crucial that you give it the bucket i don't know what the

1630
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:04,639
bucket destroyer will do if it can't destroy your bucket destroying buckets

1631
02:12:04,639 --> 02:12:09,520
is all it knows that is its singular personality trait

1632
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:13,520
sure i can hear you saying how does a character with only one personality

1633
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:17,840
trait deserve to join the pantheon of beloved stanley parable characters well

1634
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:21,840
you see if you were to really explore the bucket destroyer you would see that

1635
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:25,920
its desire to crush buckets is so densely loaded with complexity and

1636
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:30,400
nuance that it's really like 10 personality traits what other object in

1637
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:34,639
this game can you even say that about the broom closet certainly not i wonder

1638
02:12:34,639 --> 02:12:38,320

02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:47,590

wow i got scammed

1689
02:17:56,160 --> 02:18:00,240
i got [ __ ] scammed that's not real stepping into his manager's office

1690
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:04,319
stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication didn't bring

1691
02:18:04,319 --> 02:18:07,920
me anywhere who makes an elevator just for the sake

1692
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:12,399
of staying in one spot into an emotional dumpster fire if not for the soothing

1693
02:18:12,399 --> 02:18:16,960
presence of the bucket even now in his darkest of hours did the

1694
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:22,319
bucket's warmth and guiding light pierce the dark clouds of confusion and chaos

1695
02:18:22,319 --> 02:18:26,399
it would be with him always the bucket would

1696
02:18:26,399 --> 02:18:30,559
and he knew it will guide me

1697
02:18:30,559 --> 02:18:34,719
at this point stanley was so absorbed in the tender spiritual connection he

1698
02:18:34,719 --> 02:18:38,000
shared with the bucket that he didn't notice the keypad behind the button i

1699
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:42,160
literally see it right here in his bliss of simply being near the bucket did he

1700
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:46,800
have you're making me sound like i am like just

1701
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:51,760
i am obsessed with the bucket you're acting like i i i put it to bed every

1702
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:57,840
night and i kiss it and i like feed it dinner and i cuddle the bucket to eight

1703
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:02,719
four five see stanley but stanley guessed the correct code by sheer luck

1704
02:19:02,719 --> 02:19:07,040
what was it what do you mean

1705
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:13,200
yes this is certainly the most logical explanation

1706
02:19:16,880 --> 02:19:20,559
oh my god oh my god here's another figurine the name of these little

1707
02:19:20,559 --> 02:19:26,000
stanley figurines and now i'm torn between stan lorene's and figlis what do

1708
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:30,240
you think stanley what name better encapsulates the intrinsic sense of

1709
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:33,679
happiness that you get from seeing a small number in the corner of your

1710
02:19:33,679 --> 02:19:39,280
screen go up i walk as a figure sit on it i'm sure it will come to me

1711
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:44,000
i feel like i'm getting more deranged you know like how how i'm game wards

1712
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,960
arranged as we go along with this charade of a game

1713
02:19:48,960 --> 02:19:52,880
where are these huh what is this you think this is all some kind of stanley

1714
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:57,840
parable to you huh huh narrator

1715
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:18,479
reassuring that in this darkest moment of uncertainty he would be right

1716
02:20:18,479 --> 02:20:24,240
the bucket is here everything will be fine

1717
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:31,680
okay i'm fine i'm okay

1718
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:35,200
the bucket got me i know if no one else got me the bucket of god you can walk

1719
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:38,399
straight ahead through the large door than red escape

1720
02:20:38,399 --> 02:20:42,240
control facility although this passageway had the word

1721
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:46,800
escape written on it the truth was that at the end of this hall stanley and the

1722
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:51,120
bucket would both meet a violent death

1723
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:02,319
i think you're lying you're a liar you are a liar

1724
02:21:02,479 --> 02:21:06,399
i'm not gonna die the door behind them was not shut

1725
02:21:06,399 --> 02:21:10,479
stanley and the bucket still had every opportunity to turn around and get back

1726
02:21:10,479 --> 02:21:13,640
on track

1727
02:21:16,319 --> 02:21:20,399
at this point stanley and the bucket were knowingly walking forward into a

1728
02:21:20,399 --> 02:21:24,960
very painful death for each of them very painful death

1729
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:30,080
what's the very painful death huh what's down here

1730
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:37,880
do i just go back

1731
02:21:40,319 --> 02:21:43,280
me and you bucket

1732
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:50,160
huh hey we're fine

1733
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:54,399
we're perfectly fine the narrator lied oh my god maybe he

1734
02:21:54,399 --> 02:21:57,760
lied to me because he didn't want me to find this

1735
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:02,479
oh no oh no oh no as the machine worked into motion oh yeah in the bucket inch

1736
02:22:02,479 --> 02:22:07,040
closer to their demise stanley reflected on how meaningless the bucket's warmth

1737
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:12,000
and comfort had turned out to be to be sure it puts the mind and the soul at

1738
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:16,160
ease to embrace the bucket but what use is a sense of ease when you're about to

1739
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:22,080
be crushed to death uh bucket do something [ __ ] it guys chat do

1740
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:27,439
something help me help help farewell

1741
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:35,040
oh farewell stanley cried the narrator as

1742
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:39,600
stanley and the bucket were led helplessly into the enormous metal jaws

1743
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:44,960
in a single visceral instant the bucket's life came to an end as it

1744
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:49,640
was crushed violently to death

1745
02:22:54,640 --> 02:22:57,040
mommy

1746
02:22:58,319 --> 02:23:04,080
mommy it was a shame the death of such a magnificent bucket it's true that all

1747
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:09,760
buckets are agent in their own way but this one stood above the rest it was a

1748
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:13,359
glorious bucket to behold bucket saved me

1749
02:23:13,359 --> 02:23:18,479
the bucket saved me the bucket welcomes you to the grand

1750
02:23:18,479 --> 02:23:22,160
exhibits you are standing at the precipice of

1751
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:25,760
knowledge much like the bucket itself the human mind is frequently empty

1752
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:30,160
within a cavernous void but through the either use of the exhibition in front of

1753
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:34,640
you the mind comes full and enriched and substantiated knowledge of the bucket

1754
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:38,319
and it's not history is the only true knowledge we really have you take what

1755
02:23:38,319 --> 02:23:41,760
you have learned you're out with you into the world will you accept with an

1756
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:45,680
open mind what may be challenging about the information this exhibit will you

1757
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:49,520
change the lives of yourself and your loved ones as a result of this exhibit

1758
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:53,040
or will you turn a blind eye and continue to live as you were in

1759
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:56,560
ignorance and darkness

1760
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:04,880
can you see how arrogant it was for stanley to take a bucket like this and

1761
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:10,240
to claim it for his own can you see the hubris that blinded him can you see that

1762
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:17,359
my hubris is far more noble than stanley will ever be in his short life

1763
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:24,000
what happens to the narrator she's she sounds kind of kind of mom mommy as heck

1764
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:28,640
what happened to the other one the stress bucket and analogy worrying

1765
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:32,399
negative forecasting negative thinking lack of reassurance this is like some

1766
02:24:32,399 --> 02:24:39,000
1800s psychology [ __ ] uh

1767
02:24:46,479 --> 02:24:50,479
cave drawing while we know that the buckets predate the existence of mankind

1768
02:24:50,479 --> 02:24:54,399
we do not know how long this cave drawing depicts early man's discovery of

1769
02:24:54,399 --> 02:24:57,760
the practical uses of the bucket by which time the bucket had already likely

1770
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:01,120
been around for several millennia notice in these drawings how the bucket is

1771
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:07,120
allowing itself to be used having judged humanity to be worthy of its treasures

1772
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:12,720
no man can own a bucket and certainly not a bucket as dazzling to behold as

1773
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:16,399
this one it is man who should kneel before the

1774
02:25:16,399 --> 02:25:19,680
bucket what

1775
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:24,479
the hanging bucket this piece symbolizes the necessary

1776
02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:28,240
relationship between buckets and humanity our clearer grasp of the bucket

1777
02:25:28,240 --> 02:25:33,200
may be there is yet more that is always out of reach this distance inevitably is

1778
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:36,080
for our own good

1779
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:41,840
the bucket analogy is actually a thing i i guess i jump in the whole oh

1780
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:44,000
oh

1781
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,240
is this heaven we can do something we can do together

1782
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:57,120
you and i that will right this terrible wrong

1783
02:25:58,160 --> 02:26:02,720
let stanley die let him be crushed by the machine no

1784
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:06,720
reset the game don't give him another opportunity to run off with another

1785
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:10,560
beautiful bucket we can save the world's buckets from their treatment as tools

1786
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:14,960
and implements if only we let stanley die together the bucket shall take its

1787
02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:21,720
place as ruler as leader as commander of a new world a new vision

1788
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:28,720
i died

1789
02:26:30,240 --> 02:26:33,960
i i actually died

1790
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:40,640
i [ __ ] gots

1791
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:47,040

1800
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:28,560
my i've gone through so many emotions like this game like really brought me up

1801
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:33,120
and down to the highest points and the lowest points and everywhere in between

1802
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:36,720
like just going up and down up and down up

1803
02:27:36,720 --> 02:27:41,040
and down up and down up and down like i'm bouncing on some [ __ ] but no this is

through a rollercoaster and it is it is it just doesn't get any it just makes me

1806
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:53,760
is really like rubbing salt on the wound

1807
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:57,840

1857
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:50,399
i go down there i go down

1858
02:31:50,399 --> 02:31:54,240
this was not the correct way to the meeting room but stanley had felt the

1859
02:31:54,240 --> 02:31:59,040
bucket calling to him telling him that the employee lounge was simply the place

1860
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:01,520
to be and here it is i know exactly where i

1861
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:05,680
want to go again i'm going to jump off i want to jump off the knee and go down to

1862
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:08,560
the catwalk again and see if anything changes

1863
02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:12,560
left to go back to the meeting room

1864
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:15,840
now said the bucket don't go to the meeting

1865
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:21,520
room go somewhere else the cargo lift yes good said the bucket now ride the

1866
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:25,920
lift all the way to the top there's something up there i need you to do

1867
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:29,200
stanley did not miss that voice bucket was speaking to

1868
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:33,439
him it should have alarmed him of course because buckets can't talk but stanley

1869
02:32:33,439 --> 02:32:37,520
chose not to think about this obvious fact he was firmly convinced that the

1870
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:41,760
bucket had spoken to him and he unthinkingly did whatever the bucket

1871
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:44,880
asked is it gonna be the same thing again is

1872
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:49,040
he gonna make me like be like oh no buckets allowed

1873
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:53,120
no stop [ __ ] up there on the wall you see there's a sign right there it says

1874
02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:57,920
no buckets past this point stanley how could you think it was okay give me the

1875
02:32:57,920 --> 02:33:01,920
same thing again unless what if the problem is that you actually don't know

1876
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:05,680
what is a bucket and what i know what's a bucket and what in the bucket you

1877
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:08,880
can't do this to me again

1878
02:33:11,439 --> 02:33:14,640

1881
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:27,520

1882
02:33:27,520 --> 02:33:30,479

1888
02:34:15,439 --> 02:34:20,640

mind control facility all right what's in here huh

1894
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:51,920
what's in here what's the big idea

1895
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:55,520
on an enormous room packed with television screens

1896
02:34:55,520 --> 02:35:00,080
what horrible secret did this place hold stanley and the bucket both wandered to

1897
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:02,640
themselves

1898
02:35:03,439 --> 02:35:07,760
stanley and the buckets and the buckets

1899
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:11,680
and the buckets the monitors jumped to life and stanley

1900
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:15,680
nearly dropped the bucket in shock everyone in the office was being

1901
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:19,040
videotaped is there a bucket in one of these

1902
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:23,600
wait what about the ones that are fired like this and who's the fired ones burst

1903
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:26,479
into cradled it tears

1904
02:35:26,479 --> 02:35:29,920
reassuring it that everything would be fine

1905
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:34,880
i cradled the bucket gently and caressed the bucket i i then firmly pressed my

1906
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:40,800
lips onto the metallic surface of his of his ridges his his triple ridges and

1907
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:45,760
then i grab the wooden handle of the bucket lift it up and put it on top of

1908
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:48,560
my like

1909
02:35:49,439 --> 02:35:54,080
was the bucket under the mind control facility's influence as well had the

1910
02:35:54,080 --> 02:35:57,439
bucket been told to do things he didn't wish to do

1911
02:35:57,439 --> 02:36:02,000
what kinds of things does a bucket want to do or not want to do in the first

1912
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:07,120
place yeah i don't know i don't know i really don't know man

1913
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:10,880
don't know anything i don't even i can't even comprehend what you're saying at

1914
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:15,359
this point he screamed into the bucket he couldn't accept it his own life in

1915
02:36:15,359 --> 02:36:20,720
someone else's control never he squeezed the bucket tighter his one

1916
02:36:20,720 --> 02:36:26,720
friend the entire world bucket at this point he could trust no one except for

1917
02:36:26,720 --> 02:36:29,280
the bucket

1918
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:37,120
but here was the proof the heart of the opera being

1919
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:46,000
eating working all of it monitored and commanded from this very place

1920
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:49,840
and as the cold reality of his past began to sink in we're gonna get out

1921
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:54,479
here together bucket don't worry don't worry we're gonna get out of here

1922
02:36:56,640 --> 02:37:00,399
we're getting out of here buddy me and you me and the bucket

1923
02:37:00,399 --> 02:37:04,080
stanley in the bucket waited in blackness

1924
02:37:04,080 --> 02:37:09,600
was it over is it over it's over [Music]

1925
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:13,280
yes it's over stanley it's over defeated

1926
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:17,600
their greatest and darkest enemy freed themselves from the tyrannical grip of

1927
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:22,720
the evil mind control machine freedom was now mere moments away

1928
02:37:22,720 --> 02:37:26,240
excitedly the two of them began to discuss the kind of life they wanted to

1929
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:30,080
live once they stepped through this massive me in the bucket my kid wanted

1930
02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:34,479
to learn to roller skate stanley wanted to sneeze in every country on earth why

1931
02:37:34,479 --> 02:37:38,960
both of them wanted to begin watching a movie any movie but then stop it halfway

1932
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:42,479
through and begin watching it in reverse from the end

1933
02:37:42,479 --> 02:37:46,319
true it was a simple life they envisioned but it was one they'd lived

1934
02:37:46,319 --> 02:37:52,240
together with one another to lean on to trust to support

1935
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:58,960
hello wait what was happening no why had the door stopped no was stanley in the

1936
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:04,560
bucket not about to be no no let me out please silence though let me out

1937
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:07,600
lingering oh no

1938
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:12,240
the truth hit stanley square in the face this building did not want the bucket to

1939
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:16,800
leave even the facility itself recognized the

1940
02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:21,280
incredible calming presence of the buffet needed the soothing warmth of the

1941
02:38:21,280 --> 02:38:27,040
bucking will go to any lengths not to part with the bucket what but

1942
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:31,520
stanley can't leave this place not while he has such a precious bucket in his

1943
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:35,120
arms not while this building has anything to say about it

1944
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:39,840
stanley realized he would never again leave this very room but at least at

1945
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:44,800
least he has the bucket to be trapped eternally in darkness isn't really so

1946
02:38:44,800 --> 02:38:49,120
bad stanley thought to himself as long as i have my bucket with me right i'll

a good bucket a strong bucket a humble bucket a committed bucket a bucket of

1965
02:40:30,319 --> 02:40:34,279
culture and distinction

1966
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:43,840
stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest and entered the door on his

1967
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:46,840
left

1968
02:40:50,319 --> 02:40:56,640

hold on wait a room of large cardboard boxes

1972
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:13,120
maybe this was not the correct way to the meeting room but stanley had felt

1973
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:17,760
the bucket calling to him telling him that the employee lounge was simply the

1974
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:21,840
place to be and here it was at the bucket maybe you

1975
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:26,399
know maybe there's more cardboard boxes there now the bucket was wrong

1976
02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:31,840
stanley took the door on his left to go back to the meeting room

1977
02:41:32,240 --> 02:41:35,439
now said the bucket don't go to the meeting

1978
02:41:35,439 --> 02:41:41,520
no go somewhere else no cargo lift yes go there wait what is that cargo lift

1979
02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:47,040
how do i get there whoa wait a second

1980
02:41:50,479 --> 02:41:55,520
oh my god i'm pogging oh my god

1981
02:41:55,520 --> 02:41:59,760

1982
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:04,479
marines very soon you'll collect the last one and then the first number will

1983
02:42:04,479 --> 02:42:07,920
equal the second number and that will be it

1984
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:11,520
we'll be different people by then different in the sense that we used to

1985
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:17,040
have none of them and now we have them all you can't go back to when you had no

1986
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:22,240
figure and marines none of us can okay

1987
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:24,960
wait does that mean i can fall from here and not die

1988
02:42:24,960 --> 02:42:28,880
hold on is this is this a safe

1989
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:33,120

1991
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:41,080

1992
02:42:43,520 --> 02:42:45,920
hello

1993
02:42:48,479 --> 02:42:50,880

1995
02:43:00,160 --> 02:43:02,479
ah

1996
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:06,840
where is this it doesn't look doesn't look very

1997
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:10,640
familiar very quiet

1998
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:17,120
okay this is day number 295

1999
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:24,640
tate number new person i don't even know i've lost track

2000
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:28,800
nothing feels real anymore

2001
02:43:28,800 --> 02:43:35,200
the longer i study this bucket the less you lost me

2002
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:40,040
anything mike you [ __ ] lost me when you said bucket the sheer

2003
02:43:40,040 --> 02:43:44,479
euphoria i feel every time

2004
02:43:44,479 --> 02:43:49,600
i pick it up no matter how many times i've done it

2005
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:54,560
it's always the same feeling

2006
02:43:54,880 --> 02:44:00,960
and the emptiness in my chest when i set it down

2007
02:44:01,279 --> 02:44:05,040
it doesn't make sense

2008
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:11,520
there's no explanation for it still he's australia i haven't figured

2009
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:20,080
out why i see the world so differently when this bucket is in my arms

2010
02:44:20,080 --> 02:44:26,560
why everything feels so sorry

2011
02:44:26,720 --> 02:44:31,359
what do i do with this treasure treasure i can

2012
02:44:31,359 --> 02:44:37,600
i like it i can monetize it what monetize the bucket

2013
02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:44,240
it's unthinkable the amounts of money people will pay for even just an hour

2014
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:49,760
with the bucket this that sounds sass it's my golden

2015
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:52,720
that sounds kind of sus but i have to be careful

2016
02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:57,840
because as soon as this gets out there's going to be a target on my back

2017
02:44:57,840 --> 02:45:02,479
even now i don't know who might be trying to get

2018
02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:06,600
what's that who's there

2019
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:14,740
[Music]

2020
02:45:25,279 --> 02:45:29,720
you sure this ain't a horror game yo

2021
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:34,800
are we gonna pretend like that never gonna happen

2022
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:37,439
narrator

2023
02:45:37,680 --> 02:45:41,840
hello all of his co-workers were gone oh what could it mean oh these are all the

2024
02:45:41,840 --> 02:45:44,720
they decided to go to the meeting room oh my god these are all the cardboard

2025
02:45:44,720 --> 02:45:48,160
boxes we ordered hey

2026
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:52,720
what's up [ __ ] the embrace of an old friend a withered

2027
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:57,600
companionship that stands the test of time stanley clutched the bucket tightly

2028
02:45:57,600 --> 02:46:05,160
to his this was not the correct way to the meeting room all in this together

2029
02:46:11,070 --> 02:46:14,149
[Music]

2030
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:23,760
i'm going to go down to the bottom i want to go to the bottom not the left

2031
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:28,560
don't go to the meeting room go somewhere else the cargo lift yes go

2032
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:32,880
there i won't die surely i won't die if i jump from this but stanley feared that

2033
02:46:32,880 --> 02:46:37,520
anybody walked might lead to the separation of himself and the bucket his

2034
02:46:37,520 --> 02:46:41,200
dearest friend so he threw himself to his death that

2035
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:47,640
they might die in one another's arms how deeply touching

2036
02:46:54,479 --> 02:46:58,000
all of his co-workers will go what happened to the cardboard boxes

2037
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:03,520
stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed a memo

2038
02:47:03,520 --> 02:47:08,160
but it made stanley want to be a better man and a better co-worker in time

2039
02:47:08,160 --> 02:47:11,600
perhaps he would become both of those hey babe

2040
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:16,319
you make me you know you you make me i want to be

2041
02:47:16,319 --> 02:47:20,399
a better man i won't be better for you babe

2042
02:47:20,399 --> 02:47:24,160
only the best version of myself that can be just for you babe

2043
02:47:24,160 --> 02:47:29,120
what the [ __ ] is that is this what is this what he wants

2044
02:47:32,640 --> 02:47:39,359
this bucket is making me lose where is somewhere both red and blue

2045
02:47:39,359 --> 02:47:44,560
somewhere that is both red and blue so does that mean somewhere purple

2046
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:48,640
because red and blue equals

2047
02:47:56,960 --> 02:48:03,840
red and blue doors oh alright hold on

2048
02:48:10,080 --> 02:48:14,080
where's the red and blue doors area oh does that mean i have to not take the

2049
02:48:14,080 --> 02:48:17,279
bucket because remember when we got to the red

2050
02:48:17,279 --> 02:48:21,600
door in the blue door area we we didn't have the bucket with us so does that

2051
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:25,120
mean i can't take the bucket with me to get

2052
02:48:25,120 --> 02:48:29,960
to that area when he was like

2053
02:48:35,279 --> 02:48:38,960
all of his co-workers were gone what could it mean

2054
02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:44,399
danny decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed a memo

2055
02:48:44,399 --> 02:48:48,479
yeah let's try it we're not bringing the bucket this time sorry guys when stanley

2056
02:48:48,479 --> 02:48:52,560
came to a set of two open doors this was not the correct way to the meeting room

2057
02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:56,800
and stanley knew it perfectly well now how do i get to the door in the right

2058
02:48:56,800 --> 02:48:59,200
door

2059
02:48:59,439 --> 02:49:03,520
what did i do last night here it was the lounge

2060
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:07,760
but eager to get back to business stanley took the first open door on his

2061
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:13,439
left no sir no i didn't i'll not do that stanley was so bad at

2062
02:49:13,439 --> 02:49:18,720
following directions it's incredible he wasn't fired years ago

2063
02:49:19,200 --> 02:49:24,000
wait if i go down hold on hold on if what if i if i go to the vents

2064
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:29,920
and i don't have the bucket does it change

2065
02:49:30,080 --> 02:49:34,640
like if i go to that room inside the vents but i don't have the bucket

2066
02:49:34,640 --> 02:49:40,680
wouldn't that be different hold on

2067
02:49:43,040 --> 02:49:46,960
stanley had now gotten himself so far off the beaten path that it seemed the

2068
02:49:46,960 --> 02:49:50,720
office had begun just so far off the beaten path that it seemed the office

2069
02:49:50,720 --> 02:49:56,640
had begun just so far off the beaten path that it seemed the office had begun

2070
02:49:59,600 --> 02:50:03,439
you didn't think i was actually just a recording did you what a silly and trite

2071
02:50:03,439 --> 02:50:07,439
explanation that would be all the back and forth between you and me all the

2072
02:50:07,439 --> 02:50:10,960
absurd adventures we've been through and it all turns out i'm just a tape

2073
02:50:10,960 --> 02:50:14,640
recording it was all justin stanley's head

2074
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:19,279
i bet that's the kind of twist you think is revelatory i bet each and every time

2075
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:22,880
you watch a movie where it turns out all to be in the main character's

2076
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:27,439
imagination you must absolutely bolt off the couch in pure shock at the

2077
02:50:27,439 --> 02:50:33,120
phenomenal and intricate storytelling it must be so simple to be you

2078
02:50:33,120 --> 02:50:37,279
life being an unending waterfall of surprises you're assuming a lot of

2079
02:50:37,279 --> 02:50:40,479
things about them how much more exciting you must find the world than the rest of

2080
02:50:40,479 --> 02:50:43,359
us do ah

2081
02:50:43,359 --> 02:50:47,680

2082
02:50:47,680 --> 02:50:54,560

2093
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:45,600
correct way to the meeting room and staff this is not the correct way to

2094
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:49,439
stop by the employee lounge first whose wife is that right now i don't know i

2095

guess it's my wife now it was okay my wife now well to get back to business

2096
02:51:55,680 --> 02:52:02,080
ncr the first open door on his left maybe i'm the wife

02:52:02,080 --> 02:52:06,080
stanley was so bad by the way it's incredible

2098
02:52:06,080 --> 02:52:08,560
my wife

2099
02:52:08,960 --> 02:52:13,040

2100
02:52:13,040 --> 02:52:17,520
not your enemy really i'm not okay if i go over there that's the blue and red

2101
02:52:17,520 --> 02:52:22,000
door stuff right difficult but the fact is that the story has been about nothing

2102
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:27,840
but you all this time if i do i jump off to go to the doors or do i go over there

02:52:31,359 --> 02:52:34,479

i was in the middle of something do you have zero consideration for others are

2106
02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:43,040

save at this moment stanley this is a real accomplishment this oh my god

2111
02:53:03,200 --> 02:53:06,720
something just for the sake of we [ __ ] did it where so many people

2112
02:53:06,720 --> 02:53:09,840
expect to be rewarded for the most trivial achievements

2113
02:53:09,840 --> 02:53:15,120
you've insisted that a job well done is its own reward do i not get a reward

2114
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:18,479
i'll tell you that i'm proud of you for collecting them all but that would be

2115
02:53:18,479 --> 02:53:24,080
like a reward and we can't have that so instead i'll just say it's done we're

2116
02:53:24,080 --> 02:53:28,080
all done here and now we can go to whatever the hell you were doing before

2117
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:33,680
you hunted for food wait i got scammed i didn't get a reward that's it

2118
02:53:33,680 --> 02:53:38,479
there's no reward oh my god now listen carefully this is important

2119
02:53:38,479 --> 02:53:42,479
stanley walked through the red door

2120
02:53:44,640 --> 02:53:49,920
perhaps you misunderstood stanley walked through the red door i still don't think

2121
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:55,200
we're communicating properly stanley all right fine go ahead stanley you want to

2122
02:53:55,200 --> 02:53:59,279
know so badly what's out there you want to find out what okay now i can go back

2123
02:53:59,279 --> 02:54:03,520
to the beginning of the game ah

2124
02:54:03,520 --> 02:54:07,840
are you do i really get nothing out of that

2125
02:54:08,640 --> 02:54:13,840
oh sorry but i have to put a pause on things it's just it's those figurines

2126
02:54:13,840 --> 02:54:18,080
what is this those figures oh my god that scared me since you have

2127
02:54:18,080 --> 02:54:22,960
every last one wasn't it just the most intrinsically fulfilling moment of your

2128
02:54:22,960 --> 02:54:27,520
entire life didn't it fill you to the brim with inner richness

2129
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:31,600
yes i know we're supposed to be telling a story but won't you please indulge me

2130
02:54:31,600 --> 02:54:34,560
with one more trip back to the memory zone

2131
02:54:34,560 --> 02:54:38,160
i would love nothing more than to revisit the figurines

2132
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:43,680
just one more time oh my god this man is

2133
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:48,960
oh you gotta make me lose my mind man okay fine we'll go back we'll go back if

2134
02:54:48,960 --> 02:54:53,200
that makes you so happy we instantly found the collectibles we

2135
02:54:53,200 --> 02:54:57,520
literally found them like within the hour you're acting like i found them

2136
02:54:57,520 --> 02:55:01,240
back in 2010.

2137
02:55:03,359 --> 02:55:06,960
okay ah

2138
02:55:06,960 --> 02:55:11,520
here's where it all began the first collectible back then we had

2139
02:55:11,520 --> 02:55:15,279
no idea of how many of them we'd find sure it's at six right there on the

2140
02:55:15,279 --> 02:55:19,920
screen but how could we know for certain we were so innocent

2141
02:55:19,920 --> 02:55:23,920
we'll never be like that again stanley

2142
02:55:25,279 --> 02:55:28,640
wait where is this

2143
02:55:29,120 --> 02:55:34,640
where is this i hear something creepy wait and here was a second stan marine

2144
02:55:34,640 --> 02:55:39,840
i'll be honest back then i had no faith in you to find any of them let alone six

2145
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:46,720
but you continue to surprise me in all sorts of mundane unremarkable ways

2146
02:55:47,520 --> 02:55:53,120
okay let's do a little quiz huh which of these rooms was the room you found your

2147
02:55:53,120 --> 02:55:57,720
third mini stand can you remember

2148
02:56:01,200 --> 02:56:07,359
i think we found it in the bathroom i'm pretty sure that's where we found it

2149
02:56:07,359 --> 02:56:11,760
right hey that's exactly right it was here in

2150
02:56:11,760 --> 02:56:16,720
the boss's bathroom it was the third one you picked it up and then after that you

2151
02:56:16,720 --> 02:56:20,080
had three of them i didn't pick up the first one by accident it was so crystal

2152
02:56:20,080 --> 02:56:24,880
clear in your memory but i shouldn't be surprised after all science tells us

2153
02:56:24,880 --> 02:56:30,000
that it's impossible to forget your third time doing anything

2154
02:56:30,640 --> 02:56:35,359
it's impossible to forget my third time doing anything

2155
02:56:35,359 --> 02:56:39,920
let's see what came next oh yes we found a fig in this pink room

2156
02:56:39,920 --> 02:56:43,439
oh well i can't actually say i remember being in this room we were never here

2157
02:56:43,439 --> 02:56:47,200
before the memory zone so it must have happened

2158
02:56:47,200 --> 02:56:49,520
why

2159
02:56:52,399 --> 02:56:56,960
this was the fifth ministan and this one was really something special it was in

2160
02:56:56,960 --> 02:57:02,880
the warehouse i remember it so clearly in fact because this one is particularly

2161
02:57:02,880 --> 02:57:08,319
special to me i made a little video to commemorate the occasion enjoy you made

2162
02:57:08,319 --> 02:57:11,399
a video

2163
02:57:14,660 --> 02:57:18,660
[Music]

2164
02:57:22,160 --> 02:57:27,240
i i hate this game of so much what is this

2165
02:57:27,240 --> 02:57:32,720
2005 edits style oh my god bro

2166
02:57:32,720 --> 02:57:37,840
this is so dumb this is so dumb

2167
02:57:44,300 --> 02:57:47,410
[Music]

2168
02:57:51,840 --> 02:57:54,640
best boy

2169
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:59,200
takes you back doesn't it i spent a lot of time making that video but it was

2170
02:57:59,200 --> 02:58:04,760
eight minutes i wouldn't have spent on anything else

2171
02:58:04,800 --> 02:58:07,840
and now where am i going

2172
02:58:08,880 --> 02:58:11,760
what the [ __ ] even what's that i don't know

2173
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:15,680
what even was that and then right then we came to the last collectible yeah the

2174
02:58:15,680 --> 02:58:20,240
final figurine right here by the red and blue doors this memory is the most

2175
02:58:20,240 --> 02:58:24,319
distinct and clear in my mind perhaps because it was the one that happened

2176
02:58:24,319 --> 02:58:28,319
more recently than all the others you're you're a funny guy

2177
02:58:28,319 --> 02:58:32,399
you know that works all i know is that this is the moment where you picked up a

2178
02:58:32,399 --> 02:58:38,240
fig and i thought to myself yes that's all of them they're all collected it was

2179
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:42,880
a moment unlike any other except for the other moments picking up

2180
02:58:42,880 --> 02:58:47,840
figurines which it was exactly like

2181
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:53,279
oh wait they're both to the same area

2182
02:58:56,160 --> 02:58:58,960
you are in the present and then

2183
02:58:58,960 --> 02:59:03,840
there was no more because we've caught up to the present moment nothing left to

2184
02:59:03,840 --> 02:59:09,920
do would move onward into the future goodbye memory zone

2185
02:59:13,279 --> 02:59:17,040
um no no no i'm not done i'm not ready to

2186
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:21,200
move on stop the loading screen isn't there some way we can stay here keep

2187
02:59:21,200 --> 02:59:25,760
enjoying these figurines let's just go backwards no we'll do the memory zone

2188
02:59:25,760 --> 02:59:28,880
again from the opposite direction see how that feels

2189
02:59:28,880 --> 02:59:32,399
i'm scared i don't want to go back i don't want to go back

2190
02:59:32,399 --> 02:59:35,840
what is this man doing to me

2191
02:59:38,240 --> 02:59:42,560
all the illusion of choice yes sir okay yes the room with the red

2192
02:59:42,560 --> 02:59:47,520
and blue doors i remember this i must say of all the figurines we

2193
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:51,520
looked at in our initial tour of the memory zone this one he's making me do

2194
02:59:51,520 --> 02:59:57,120
it again clear in my mind oh my god get me out

2195
02:59:57,120 --> 03:00:03,040
you better not play another video don't you remember the video we watched

2196
03:00:07,200 --> 03:00:11,200
yes love that video

2197
03:00:11,200 --> 03:00:14,399
you you showed it to me like one second ago

2198
03:00:14,399 --> 03:00:18,080
what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is happening you don't

2199
03:00:18,080 --> 03:00:22,000
remember the pink room stanley still no memory of this one yeah this one's weird

2200
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:25,359
though a solid room i don't think we got it from the pink room did we get it from

2201
03:00:25,359 --> 03:00:29,359
the pink room i don't remember i really don't remember

2202
03:00:29,359 --> 03:00:33,520
these really were a treat to hunt down you know if there had been any kind of

2203
03:00:33,520 --> 03:00:37,600
reward for finding all of these it really would have muted the intrinsic

2204
03:00:37,600 --> 03:00:44,399
joy of collecting them i'm very glad we resisted the temptation next one

2205
03:00:46,080 --> 03:00:49,359
is definitely a horror game i am

2206
03:00:49,359 --> 03:00:51,439
living hell

2207
03:00:51,439 --> 03:00:55,359
right now this was our second fig don't you

2208
03:00:55,359 --> 03:01:00,479
remember yes i remember i remember it because this is like the third time

2209
03:01:00,479 --> 03:01:04,640
why does anyone ever choose to leave it keep going

2210
03:01:04,640 --> 03:01:10,720
oh wait hold on wait let me grab it oops sorry okay i grabbed it 16 16.

2211
03:01:12,560 --> 03:01:16,880

2212
03:01:16,880 --> 03:01:22,399
where i introduced you to the figurines oh i want more memories stanley i want

2219
03:01:45,279 --> 03:01:50,880
oh yes the two doors oh god [ __ ] that a classic memory

2220
03:01:50,880 --> 03:01:53,359
this one

2221
03:01:56,240 --> 03:01:59,760
what's wrong with him and before everything else there was

2222
03:01:59,760 --> 03:02:03,160
your office

2223
03:02:03,359 --> 03:02:07,439
yeah is there anything else was there something that came before your office

2224
03:02:07,439 --> 03:02:13,279
there's something i feel i can remember i can remember i can remember

2225
03:02:14,479 --> 03:02:18,240
what do you remember yes i'm remembering something now

2226
03:02:18,240 --> 03:02:22,800
i remember before this whole story got started back then i was

2227
03:02:22,800 --> 03:02:26,240
i was different i used to make big decisions i was

2228
03:02:26,240 --> 03:02:30,640
passionate i was skeptical i weighed each decision with profound

2229
03:02:30,640 --> 03:02:35,840
thoughtfulness and then somewhere along the way i stopped making decisions

2230
03:02:35,840 --> 03:02:40,560
i became lazy and i came up with well came up with a character named stanley

2231
03:02:40,560 --> 03:02:44,640
to do my thinking for me he would make the decisions he would decide which way

2232
03:02:44,640 --> 03:02:47,279
to go i would cheer him on as he collected

2233
03:02:47,279 --> 03:02:51,439
figurines for no reason why did i invent stanley

2234
03:02:51,439 --> 03:02:56,000
was i lonely yes perhaps that's it perhaps i needed to imagine i had

2235
03:02:56,000 --> 03:03:00,800
companionship and stanley really did make for a wonderful companion even if

2236
03:03:00,800 --> 03:03:05,520
he was a fiction but i suppose it's grown old i

2237
03:03:05,520 --> 03:03:10,240
i want to think for myself again i want to go back to how it used to be

2238
03:03:10,240 --> 03:03:16,640
yes i can be on my own again i can do it i'll be stronger this time i'll take

2239
03:03:16,640 --> 03:03:22,720
care of myself i don't need stanley anymore oh but he truly was so much fun

2240
03:03:22,720 --> 03:03:25,120
to play with you know what

2241
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:30,560
since we're in the memory zone how about one more good memory let's go back just

2242
03:03:30,560 --> 03:03:35,520
once and give stanley one more run of the office and then i'll retire him for

2243
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:41,120
good i did enjoy telling his story so very much okay

2244
03:03:41,120 --> 03:03:48,000
here we go this is the story of a man named stanley

2245
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:55,359
the end is never the end i think i think that's the end though wait hold on is

2246
03:03:55,359 --> 03:03:59,200
that actually the end or is it is like okay how about we do it one more time

2247
03:03:59,200 --> 03:04:02,960
and he just it's just like a loop again we do literally everything again i don't

2248
03:04:02,960 --> 03:04:09,319
know or that is i think that's it right

2249
03:04:09,840 --> 03:04:13,840
maybe one more one more

2250
03:04:13,840 --> 03:04:17,279
all of his co-workers were gone what could it mean

2251
03:04:17,279 --> 03:04:20,479
you missed some endings

2252
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:24,880
not everyone is so lucky to have a bucket but stanley is a very it's a loop

2253
03:04:24,880 --> 03:04:28,399
guys guys it's a loop i'm pretty sure it's a loop and it's just like oh how

2254
03:04:28,399 --> 03:04:31,600
about we do it one more time and then they're gonna bring me again through

2255
03:04:31,600 --> 03:04:35,080
everything yeah

2256
03:04:39,120 --> 03:04:41,200
okay okay

2257
03:04:41,200 --> 03:04:49,000
look it's never ending this game never ends it just goes on forever okay

2258
03:04:49,680 --> 03:04:52,000
ah

2259
03:04:55,680 --> 03:04:59,760
i am i have been put through

2260
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:05,520
a lot of mental torment from this game

2261
03:05:05,520 --> 03:05:08,880
was it fun yes it was but

2262
03:05:08,880 --> 03:05:16,399
did it break me yes it did it broke me somehow it broke me

2263
03:05:16,399 --> 03:05:19,040
i i i can never

2264
03:05:19,040 --> 03:05:24,160
look at a bucket the same way again dude

2265
03:05:24,160 --> 03:05:30,640
i can never look at a bucket the same [ __ ] way again without thinking about

2266
03:05:30,640 --> 03:05:36,399
the tractor i'm gonna look at a tractor and be like is this a bucket

2267
03:05:36,399 --> 03:05:40,880
like you know how much damage that is that's a lot of damage

2268
03:05:40,880 --> 03:05:44,840
that's a lot of damage my guy

2269
03:05:44,840 --> 03:05:48,960
ah okay i'm gonna drink some water give me a

2270
03:05:48,960 --> 03:05:51,359
second

2271
03:05:56,319 --> 03:05:59,760
i'm done i'm done that's it

2272
03:05:59,760 --> 03:06:03,120
we are done with the stanley parable there is no more there is no more
